== TinyClone

This sample application is based on the code by Chang Sau Sheong, author
of the Book "Cloning Internet Applications with Ruby", which you can buy
at:

The original source code used a combination of Sinatra, DataMapper and HAML,
and for a workshop I presented, I decided to rewrite it in Rails 3.

There are a few minor feature modification and some specs that I added. The
overall look and feel is still the same, though.
